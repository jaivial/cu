# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The server read a request with a single `read()` into a fixed buffer, so a
  client that wrote its request in several TCP segments was cut off
  mid-request and `cu status` failed intermittently. Requests are now read
  until the end of the header block and then up to `Content-Length`.

### Added

- Integration tests covering `status`, `navigate` and `screenshot`, plus a
  fake Chromium DevTools endpoint used by the tests.
- `CU_CDP_PORT` to point the daemon at a non-default DevTools port.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-06

- Added the local persistent Chromium session server and saved profile directory.
- Added bearer-authenticated status, navigation/session endpoints, and a secure login page.
- Added the `cu` CLI and Rust `Client` SDK.
- Added agent-facing documentation and security guidance.
